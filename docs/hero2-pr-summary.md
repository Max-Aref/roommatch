# RoomMatch Hero2 Implementation

## Overview

This PR adds a stunning new Hero2 component to our roommate matching
application. The component follows a modern, visually engaging design with an
immersive layout, interactive search functionality, and delightful
micro-interactions.

## Key Features

### Visual Design

- Full viewport height hero with 60/40 two-column layout
- Gradient mesh background with floating profile cards
- Glassmorphism UI elements with subtle animations
- Custom floating and ping animations

### Functional Elements

- Three-field integrated search bar with icon indicators
- Quick action buttons for different user journeys
- Trust indicators with user statistics
- Interactive profile card previews

### Technical Implementation

- Fully responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Custom Tailwind animations and keyframes
- React state management for form fields
- Accessible semantic HTML structure

## Implementation Details

### New Files

- `src/components/Hero2.tsx` - The main Hero2 component
- `docs/hero2-component.md` - Comprehensive documentation

### Modified Files

- `tailwind.config.ts` - Added custom animations and keyframes
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Updated to include both Hero components

### Technical Choices

1. **Animation Approach**

   - Used Tailwind's built-in animation system extended with custom keyframes
   - Different timing for each floating card creates natural, organic feel
   - CSS-based animations for better performance

2. **Layout Structure**

   - CSS Grid for the main 60/40 layout with responsive breakpoints
   - Flexbox for nested elements like trust indicators and action buttons
   - Absolute positioning for floating cards with transform translations

3. **Search Component**
   - Combined three separate input fields with dividers
   - State management for each field
   - Custom styling with icons and subtle hover states

## Design Elements

### Colors

- Deep Navy (`#1E3A8A`) for main heading
- Ocean Blue (`#2563EB`) for trust indicators and accents
- Coral (`#F97316`) for primary action button
- Gradient from Ocean Blue to Sky Blue to Mint for illustrations

### Typography

- Outfit (700) for main heading
- Inter (400) for body text and inputs
- Size hierarchy: 56px heading, 20px subtitle, 16px body

### Special Effects

- Backdrop blur for glassmorphism cards
- Subtle shadow elevation on hover states
- Floating animations with different timing
- Gradient mesh background with decorative elements

## Testing Notes

- Verified responsive behavior across mobile, tablet and desktop breakpoints
- Confirmed all animations render properly in modern browsers
- Validated keyboard navigation for accessibility

## Next Steps

- Connect search functionality to actual search results page
- Implement actual profile data fetching
- Add internationalization for text content
- Consider A/B testing different variations of the hero layout
