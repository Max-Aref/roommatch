# "How It Works" Component PR Summary

## Overview

This PR introduces an elegant, animated "How It Works" section that explains our
3-step roommate matching process to users. The component features a responsive
design with animated cards, connecting lines with moving dots, and detailed
process descriptions.

## Key Features

### Visual Design

- Clean three-card layout with 380px width cards
- Custom gradient step numbers and pulsing icons
- Dashed connecting lines with animated dots
- Subtle entrance animations on scroll

### Interaction Elements

- Cards scale up and increase shadow on hover
- Dots travel along connector lines in an infinite loop
- Cards fade in with a staggered animation as they enter viewport
- Icons pulse gently to draw attention

### Content Structure

- Each step has a clear title, description, and supporting bullet points
- Check-marked bullet points highlight key features
- Custom icons represent each step in the process
- Consistent styling maintains visual hierarchy

## Implementation Details

### New Files

- `src/components/HowItWorks.tsx` - Main component
- `docs/how-it-works-component.md` - Documentation

### Modified Files

- `tailwind.config.ts` - Added custom animations for fade-in, dot travel, and
  pulse effects
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Added HowItWorks component to main page

### Technical Highlights

1. **Custom Animations**

   - Created new keyframes for fade-in entrance
   - Implemented dot-travel animation along connector paths
   - Added subtle pulsing effect for step icons

2. **Intersection Observer**

   - Custom `useInViewport` hook triggers animations when elements enter
     viewport
   - Ensures animations only play when users can see them
   - Improves performance by not animating off-screen elements

3. **Responsive Design**

   - Cards stack vertically on mobile for better readability
   - Connector lines hide on smaller screens
   - Maintains consistent padding and spacing across breakpoints

4. **Reusable Components**
   - `StepCard` component can be reused for other step-based processes
   - `ConnectorLine` provides visual flow between any sequential elements
   - Animation timings are customizable through props

## Design Decisions

### Card Layout

Chose to use equal-width cards (380px) with consistent padding to maintain
visual balance across the section. Cards have ample whitespace to improve
readability and focus attention on the step content.

### Animation Approach

Implemented subtle animations that enhance the user experience without being
distracting. The staggered entrance creates a natural reading flow, while the
traveling dots reinforce the sequential nature of the steps.

### Color Scheme

Used the existing color palette with gradient accents to maintain consistency
with the brand. The Ocean Blue gradient (#2563EB to #0EA5E9) ties in with other
elements across the site.

## Testing Notes

- Verified responsive behavior across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints
- Confirmed animations work properly in modern browsers
- Tested with different screen readers for accessibility

## Next Steps

- Consider implementing A/B testing to measure engagement with this section
- Potentially add interactive elements like tooltips for additional information
- Explore adding testimonial quotes to reinforce the effectiveness of each step
