## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Persona Analytics Setup**

```tsx
// Track persona-specific interactions
const trackPersonaInteraction = (persona: string, action: string) => {
  analytics.track(`${persona}_${action}`, {
    userRole,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    page: pathname,
  });
};
```

### **Phase 2: Adaptive Header Features**

```tsx
// Persona-specific header enhancements
const getPersonaFeatures = (userRole: string, userData: any) => {
  switch (userRole) {
    case "manager":
      return {
        showPropertyCount: true,
        urgentAlerts: userData.urgentMaintenance > 0,
        bulkActions: true,
      };
    case "landlord":
      return {
        showRevenue: true,
        applicationAlerts: userData.pendingApplications > 0,
        mobileOptimized: true,
      };
    case "tenant":
      return {
        showSavedSearches: userData.savedSearches > 0,
        applicationStatus: userData.applicationStatus,
        supportChat: true,
      };
  }
};
```

### **Phase 3: A/B Testing Framework**

```tsx
// Persona-segmented A/B testing
const PersonaVariant = ({ persona, children }: PersonaVariantProps) => {
  const variant = useABTest(`header_${persona}_variant`);
  return (
    <div data-persona={persona} data-variant={variant}>
      {children}
